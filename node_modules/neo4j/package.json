  "readme": "# Node-Neo4j\n\nThis is a client library for accessing [Neo4j][], a graph database, from\n[Node.js][]. It uses Neo4j's [REST API][neo4j-rest-api].\n\nThis library supports and has been tested against Neo4j 1.4 through Neo4j 1.8.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install neo4j\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo start, create a new instance of the `GraphDatabase` class pointing to your\nNeo4j instance:\n\n```js\nvar neo4j = require('neo4j');\nvar db = new neo4j.GraphDatabase('http://localhost:7474');\n```\n\nNode.js is asynchronous, which means this library is too: most functions take\ncallbacks and return immediately, with the callbacks being invoked when the\ncorresponding HTTP requests and responses finish.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```js\nvar node = db.createNode({hello: 'world'});     // instantaneous, but...\nnode.save(function (err, node) {    // ...this is what actually persists.\n    if (err) {\n        console.err('Error saving new node to database:', err);\n    } else {\n        console.log('Node saved to database with id:', node.id);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nBecause async flow in Node.js can be significantly tricky to handle, we\nstrongly recommend using a flow control tool or library to help.\nOur personal favorite is [Streamline.js][], but other popular choices are\n[async](https://github.com/caolan/async),\n[Step](https://github.com/creationix/step),\n[Seq](https://github.com/substack/node-seq), [TameJS](http://tamejs.org/) and\n[IcedCoffeeScript](http://maxtaco.github.com/coffee-script/).\n\nOnce you've gotten the basics down, skim through the full\n**[API documentation][api-docs]** to see what this library can do, and take a\nlook at [@aseemk][aseemk]'s [node-neo4j-template][] app for a complete usage\nexample. (The `models/User.js` file in particular is the one that interacts\nwith this library.)\n\nPlease note that **breaking changes to this library are *very* likely** in the\nnear future as we consider an API overhaul, but the version number will always\nrespect [semantic versioning][semver]. So if you specify this library as a\ndependency in your package.json, ***please* specify something like `0.2.x` or\n`~0.2.6`, *not* `>=0.2.6`**. Thanks. =)\n\n\n## Development\n\n    git clone git@github.com:thingdom/node-neo4j.git\n    cd node-neo4j\n    npm install && npm run clean\n\nYou'll also need a local Neo4j database instance for the tests:\n\n    curl http://dist.neo4j.org/neo4j-community-1.8.2-unix.tar.gz --O neo4j-community-1.8.2-unix.tar.gz\n    tar -zxvf neo4j-community-1.8.2-unix.tar.gz\n    rm neo4j-community-1.8.2-unix.tar.gz\n    ln -s neo4j-community-1.8.2/bin/neo4j neo4j\n\nIf you're new to Neo4j, read the [Getting Started][neo4j-getting-started] page.\nStart the server:\n\n    ./neo4j start\n\nStop the server:\n\n    ./neo4j stop\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n    npm test\n\n**Important:** The tests are written assuming Neo4j >=1.7 and will now fail on\nprior Neo4j versions, but the library supports prior Neo4j versions just fine.\n\nThis library is written in [CoffeeScript][], using [Streamline.js][] syntax.\nThe tests automatically compile the code on-the-fly, but you can also generate\ncompiled `.js` files from the source `._coffee` files manually:\n\n    npm run build\n\nThis is in fact what's run each time this library is published to npm.\nBut please don't check the generated `.js` files in; to remove:\n\n    npm run clean\n\nWhen compiled `.js` files exist, changes to the source `._coffee` files will\n*not* be picked up automatically; you'll need to rebuild.\n\nIf you `npm link` this module into another app (like [node-neo4j-template][])\nand you want the code compiled on-the-fly during development, you can create\nan `index.js` file under `lib/` with the following:\n\n```js\nrequire('coffee-script');\nrequire('streamline').register();\nmodule.exports = require('./index._coffee');\n```\n\nBut don't check this in! That would cause all clients to compile the code\non-the-fly every time, which isn't desirable in production.\n\n\n## Changes\n\nSee the [Changelog][changelog] for the full history of changes and releases.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis library is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0][license].\n\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you encounter any bugs or other issues, please file them in the\n[issue tracker][issue-tracker].\n\nWe also now have a [Google Group][google-group]!\nPost questions and participate in general discussions there.\n\n\n[neo4j]: http://neo4j.org/\n[node.js]: http://nodejs.org/\n[neo4j-rest-api]: http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/rest-api.html\n\n[api-docs]: http://coffeedoc.info/github/thingdom/node-neo4j/master/\n[aseemk]: https://github.com/aseemk\n[node-neo4j-template]: https://github.com/aseemk/node-neo4j-template\n[semver]: http://semver.org/\n\n[neo4j-getting-started]: http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Getting_Started_With_Neo4j_Server\n[coffeescript]: http://coffeescript.org/\n[streamline.js]: https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs\n\n[changelog]: CHANGELOG.md\n[issue-tracker]: https://github.com/thingdom/node-neo4j/issues\n[license]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\n[google-group]: https://groups.google.com/group/node-neo4j\n",
